[[policy]]
= Community GitHub Policy

One of the key goals of Payara is to interact with our community of users and understand their needs and how are they engaging with the Payara Platform Community Edition in general. To this effect, it is important to outline the guidelines that compose the Payara GitHub policy and how we handle user requests for bug fixes and enhancements.

[[questions]]
== Questions and General Advice

For questions regarding about using the platform, visit the https://forum.payara.fish/[Payara Forum] and create a topic to discuss your inquiries in detail. This includes advice on:

* Configuration of any Payara Platform distributions
* Integration of the Payara Platform with other technologies
* Software Architecture and Best Practices
* etc.

[[user-requests]]
== User Requests

Users can request assistance by raising an issue in the project‚Äôs issue tracker and follow the template to make sure that the report is comprehensive. There are two types of user requests:

Bug Reports:: A defect or bug is present in one or multiple distributions of the Payara Platform. 
Enhancements:: Propose additional functionality and improvements to one or multiple distributions of the Payara Platform.

Engineers review user requests in detail and escalate issues to the Payara Platform Development team if all conditions are met (see below). If your request is successfully escalated you can expect that your requested fix or enhancement will be implemented as part of a future Payara Platform release. 

IMPORTANT: We do not provide guarantees of when an escalated issue is to be implemented and shipped in a future release.

[[bug-reports]]
=== Bug Reports

Follow these guidelines to report a bug or defect:

* Ensure that your report includes a http://sscce.org/[Short, Self Contained and Correct Example] scenario that we can use to verify the validity of your claim. If we can't reproduce the error using the information you provide, we‚Äôll request additional details to decide whether or not  to escalate your request.
* Make sure that your reproducer has been tested using the **current release**. If you encountered the bug on a previous version, you'll have to make the effort to test it with the latest release and confirm that the bug is present before we proceed to review the report.
* **Be involved as much as possible** in the issue's conversation. Even if a valid reproducer is provided,  our engineers may require more details to properly escalate your case and if you do not provide them in time, we‚Äôll proceed to close the issue and dismiss your request.

IMPORTANT: We reserve the right to choose NOT to escalate a bug report if we consider that the effort required to implement its fix is not aligned with the current goals of our Platform Development Team. We expect that our users understand such decisions if given the case.

[[enhancements]]
=== Enhancements

Enhancement requests are studied by Payara's Product Management team before being considered for their implementation. If the product management teams gives their approval to an enhancement request, then it'll through a community voting process before they are escalated to Payara's Platform Development team. Follow these guidelines to request a new enhancement:

* Verify that your suggested enhancement is not already part of a bigger feature that is part of the Open Roadmap for the Payara Platform (see below for more information). If this happens, we'll proceed to close the issue and dismiss your request.
* Provide a detailed explanation of the reasons you consider your suggested enhancement will be useful to the general community userbase of the Payara Platform.
* Give thoughtful consideration to the use cases and requirements for the your proposed enhancement.
* Be open to discussion. The product management team will get in touch with you to get more details of your request if needed.
* The product management team reserves the right to reject any enhancement requests if they are not aligned with the platform's vision.
* Once the product management team gives their OK, we‚Äôll proceed to submit the enhancement to an open vote, meaning that other users can and should engage on the issue and vote whether they want to see the enhancement request implemented in a future release.

NOTE: The https://github.com/orgs/payara/projects/1[Open Roadmap] is comprised of all issues labelled with the `Type:Roadmap` tag and are used to publicly advertise future features and enhancements to the Payara Platform that are in consideration of being implemented. You can read more details about the roadmap in this https://blog.payara.fish/payara-open-roadmap[blog post].

[[contributing]]
==== Community Contributions

Before submitting an enhancement issue to the voting process, we may suggest the requester implement the issue themselves if they are confident enough. As the Payara Platform Community Edition is an open source project, anyone can contribute code to the platform, which might be a better solution. Read the general contribution guidelines in the https://docs.payara.fish/community[official documentation].

NOTE: We don‚Äôt guarantee assistance from the Payara Platform Development team on enhancement issues you choose to implement on your own.

IMPORTANT: Contributions have to be vetted by the product management team first, so they might be rejected as well.

[[voting]]
==== Enhancement Issue Voting Process

Members of the community can vote on enhancement requests that have been moved into the voting process. The voting process is quite simple:

* To vote on an issue just give a thumbs-up üëç to the enhancement issue's first message. Any user with a GitHub account can do this.
* Any community user can also express their disapproval of any issue being implemented by giving a thumbs-down üëé to the enhancement issue's first message.
* It is suggested that users also participate in the conversation by sharing their thoughts on approving/disapproving the suggested improvements.
* The vote tally will be the difference between positive and negative votes.
* At the end of every month, we'll **select the top voted issue** and escalate it to our Platform Development team to be implemented in a future release.
* Only issues with **2 or more positive votes** will be considered for selection.
* In case of a tie, the issue **that was raised first will be selected first**.
* All other issues which are not selected will retain their votes and will have another chance to receive more votes the following month.
* If an enhancement issue hasn‚Äôt met the criteria to enter development‚ÄØ**6 months after the issue was first requested**,‚ÄØthe issue will be closed and we will dismiss the user‚Äôs request.

WARNING: We understand it is possible to reopen the issue if you want to give it another chance of being selected, but we kindly ask you not to do so. Raise a new issue and properly explain in detail to the general community why the issue should be considered for selection again. This way the issue starts again with‚ÄØ`0`‚ÄØvotes and has a fair chance for selection if the community is interested in it.

To keep track of the current top-voted issues we suggest you use https://vote.biglybt.com/payara/Payara/Status:%20Voting[this website], which lists the current top voted issues first and allows quick voting actions.
